The program can be used for two users. In some cases, it's find when having more users.

LOGIN: Done
MATCHING: Done
COMBAT:
-Implemented a question asking if you want to attack/speak to avoide the weirdness of the program.
(Before each attacking turn, client has to type in randome value to get to next turn.)
-Only can accept a, p, s as input, other input will ruin the program.
-Didn't implement the limit powermoves(still accepting p after powermoves run out)
-After active player drop, the other player can still wait for next user.
-After non-active player drop, the program stop.
