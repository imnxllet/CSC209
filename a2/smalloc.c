/* Initialize the memory space used by smalloc,

 * case we are using it to allocate a large region of memory. 
 * - mmap returns a pointer to the allocated memory
 * Arguments:
 * - NULL: a suggestion for where to place the memory. We will let the 
 *         system decide where to place the memory.
 * - PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE: we will use the memory for both reading
 *         and writing.
 * - MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON: the memory is just for this process, and 
 *         is not associated with a file.
 * - -1: because this memory is not associated with a file, the file 
 *         descriptor argument is set to -1
 * - 0: only used if the address space is associated with a file.
